  abstract = {In computing, a delimiter is a character or a sequence of characters for specifying the boundary between separate, independent regions in data such as a text file or data stream. For context, data boundaries can be indicated via other means. For example, declarative notation indicates the length of a field at the start of the field instead of relying on delimiters. In mathematics, delimiters are often used to specify the scope of an operation in an expression, and can occur both as isolated symbols (e.g., colon in "                        1         :         4                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 1:4\}    ") and as a pair of opposing-looking symbols (e.g., angled brackets in                         ⟨         a         ,         b         ⟩                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash langle a,b\textbackslash rangle \}    ).},
